Mentors list
============

If you don't have any project in mind, but you want to help with
mentoring, list yourself down here along with the type of stuff you
can help with, such as Perl, Raku, DevOps, Web... whatever you think
are your skills. We'll match you later to a project when and if this
proposal is funded.
